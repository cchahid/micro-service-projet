## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Read in Order**
   - Don't skip the overview
   - Architecture understanding helps

2. **Keep Documents Open**
   - Open EXECUTION_GUIDE while setting up
   - Open FRONTEND_COMPLETE_CODE while copying

3. **Use Troubleshooting**
   - If stuck, check EXECUTION_GUIDE troubleshooting section
   - Most issues are covered

4. **Test as You Go**
   - Don't wait to test everything at the end
   - Test after each step

5. **Keep Backend Running**
   - Docker containers must be running
   - Services must be registered in Eureka

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL STEPS

Don't forget these:

1. **CORS Configuration** ⚠️
   - Must add to ALL backend services
   - Without it, frontend can't communicate with backend

2. **Docker Containers** ⚠️
   - Must be running before starting frontend
   - Check with: docker-compose ps

3. **Rebuild Backend** ⚠️
   - After adding CORS, rebuild with: mvn clean install
   - Restart services after rebuild

4. **Environment Configuration** ⚠️
   - Update API URLs to match your setup
   - Check src/environments/environment.ts

5. **Dependencies Installation** ⚠️
   - Must run: npm install with all packages
   - Don't skip Bootstrap and other packages
